## Overall Performance
Accuracy of ~94.12% is quite high, but it's not the only metric for model evaluation.

Macro average F1-score = 0.47 indicates model imbalance between classes. Some classes have very low F1-scores, pulling down the overall score.

Weighted average F1-score = 0.94, reflects better performance due to consideration of class sizes.

## Performance by Class
BENIGN class (normal traffic): Precision ~96.38%, Recall ~96.87%, model performs well.

DoS/DDoS attack classes:

- DDoS has Recall ~77.47% and Precision ~95.82%, meaning the model catches many attacks but still misses 22.53%.

- DoS Hulk has Recall ~83.88%, higher than DoS Slowloris (48.94%) or DoS GoldenEye (63.21%).

- DoS Slowloris & Slowhttptest have low Recall (~48.94% and 70%), indicating confusion with other classes.

- PortScan: Precision ~71.71%, but very high Recall ~98.15%, meaning the model catches most PortScans but has some false predictions.

- Bot, Brute Force, FTP-Patator, SSH-Patator, XSS: Precision and Recall are 0, meaning the model completely fails to classify these attack types.

## Conclusion
The Logistic Regression model performs quite well for common attacks like DoS Hulk, DDoS, PortScan, but fails on rare classes like XSS, SSH-Patator.
